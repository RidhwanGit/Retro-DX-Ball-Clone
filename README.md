# Retro DX Ball Clone üïπÔ∏è

This project was originally developed as a coursework assignment for **CSE423 (Computer Graphics)**, where the primary focus was on implementing foundational concepts like rasterization algorithms and 2D game state management from scratch.

After completing the course requirements, I personally expanded and modified the project to give it a complete retro-futuristic visual overhaul, adding features like a dynamic starfield, glowing effects, and stylized pixel-art icons to create a more polished and engaging final product.
